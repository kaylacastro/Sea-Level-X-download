# Sea Level X

SeaLevelX is an architectural visualization tool meant to connect human users as part of the loop that generates sea level rise. In doing so, the hope is to harvest the user's nervousness to trigger potential outcomes. The project engages time by allowing the architect to design today while constantly interacting with the consequences of the future. 	
Using Python in Grasshopper with imported flood map data, I will create viewports for the project to run. Connected to Arduino, a pulse sensor is embedded into the Official SeaLevelX Mouse; the userâ€™s nervousness will directly affect the rate in which sea level rises. The viewports allow the designer to consider the inevitability of the future and its associations. Using VisualARQ, the user can view their project in plan, section, perspective, and elevation with ease.
