# Sea Level X

SeaLevel X is an architectural design tool meant to connect human users as part of the loop that generates sea level rise. In doing so, the hope is to harvest the user's nervousness to trigger potential outcomes. The project engages time by allowing the user to design today while constantly interacting with the consequences of the future.
	
Man-made disasters must be accounted for when designing for the future of transient environments. Simply presenting visuals or images may not be sufficient to engage people and motivate them to take action on an issue. By bringing the user physically and virtually into the future, I hope to incite an emotional response to prompt climate action.
